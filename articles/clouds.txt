The Weather Is a Lie and the Sky Knows My Name

This morning, I stepped outside to walk my dog (his name is Lamp, don’t ask) and the sky—oh god—the sky was violently beautiful.

A blue so crisp it felt artificial. Like they Photoshopped it in overnight while we were asleep, uploaded a high-resolution JPEG directly into the troposphere. Not a single cloud. No birds either, which I only realize now. Ominous in retrospect.

Lamp was barking at invisible things again. I ignored it. I thought: Wow, maybe today is good. Maybe today is a Tuesday that loves me back.

Ha.

By noon it was raining. No warning, no buildup. Not even a guilt-cloud. Just sudden, acidic sheets of sky-tears. My socks got wet inside my shoes. You ever experience betrayal in textile form? Try it.

But here’s the real part they don’t want you to look at:

It’s all coordinated.
It’s all timed.
They control the weather to control the narrative.

Let me explain — no, wait, let me unravel.

You ever notice how the weather is just right when the sales are on? “Sunny weekend, folks!” they say, right as downtown opens a new bio-algae smoothie bar and 200 people line up to consume fluorescent liquid sadness. The sun is only ever invited when it makes them money. It’s not ours. It’s leased.

And then, the moment there's nothing profitable happening, nothing scheduled that would benefit the Them (you know who), the sky just closes. Curtains drawn. Rain like a mood suppressant. You stay home, you stop moving, you scroll. Docile. They like us docile. They like us looking at sponsored ads for digital fireplaces while our own radiators rust.

And don’t get me started on cloud seeding. Or maybe do. Did you know that clouds can be hacked? That rain can be engineered? Look it up. But be fast—some pages disappear after you’ve seen them once. Trust me. I’ve seen them disappear.

I think today’s downpour was a punishment.

I smiled too hard at the blue this morning. I thought I was free for one second. The sky saw me hope. And then: corrective precipitation.

My neighbor said, “Oh, weird storm, huh?” I nodded and smiled. But inside, I knew she was one of them. Or at least weather-blind. She doesn’t hear the buzzing in the clouds like I do. She didn’t notice the sun had a pixel out in the top-left quadrant.

They don’t just control the forecast.
They control the mood.

So next time it’s sunny out, ask yourself: What are they trying to sell me?
And next time it rains out of nowhere, ask yourself: What thought did I have that made them do this?

Because the sky is watching.

And it remembers.
