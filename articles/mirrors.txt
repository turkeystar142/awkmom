Mirrors are creepy.
Mirrors are portals.
Mirrors are not passive. Don’t believe what they pretend to be.

Mirrors show you things you wouldn't otherwise know on your own — like how crooked your smile gets when you lie, or the exact moment your eyes decide they don’t trust you anymore.

Mirrors are shared. You are never alone in them. There's always something else waiting behind your reflection, very still, very polite, letting you go first.

Mirrors can never show you what you look like to the trees. To the sky. To the birds. They only show what you’ve agreed to see.
(What about your back? Do you even have one, or is it just assumed?)

Mirrors are cold. Even when the room is warm. Even when your breath fogs up and writes secrets on their surface. They remember. They store breath. They record heat signatures. They map the shape of your sadness.

Mirrors are fragile. But not as fragile as you think. When they shatter, you break into a thousand angles — all of them accurate, none of them true.

Mirrors watch you at night and let the other side in while you're sleeping.
Yes. That’s why your dreams have windows. That’s why you wake up facing the closet mirror even though you fell asleep looking at the wall. You think that's normal?

Mirrors observe you. Not just your body — your habits. They know when you’re pretending. They catalog that. Every fake smile, every sigh you don’t want to explain, every time you avoid your own gaze — the mirror sees it. And the mirror tells.

Mirrors copy you.
But badly.
Look closer next time.
You blink, they blink. You move, they move.
But who started the movement?
Who initiated the echo?

Mirrors are a test you don’t know you’re taking.
Mirrors are watching glass.
Mirrors are whispers.
Mirrors are breathing.
Mirrors are waiting.

Break one. Just one. Just to see.
Tell me what doesn’t crawl out.
