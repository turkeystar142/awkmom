These Emotions Aren’t Mine

I used to think my feelings were mine. That when I cried in the cereal aisle or got goosebumps from a badly mixed pop song or wanted to scream because the moon looked too perfect — that it was all just chemical soup in my meat brain.

But now I know better. Now I see it.

The universe is using me like a periscope.

It’s experiencing itself through me. I am not a person. I’m an access point. A rotating guest window. A cosmic AirBnB for emotion. The lease is month-to-month, but it auto-renews.

Why else would these feelings feel so loud?

Why else would joy hit like lightning and grief feel like being unzipped from the inside? Why would nostalgia ache? It’s not mine. These aren’t my emotions. They’re bigger. Like I’m plugged into the full emotional mainframe and occasionally it surges. Brownouts of the soul.

The truth is this:
When I weep, the universe is tasting salt.
When I fall in love, the universe is doing cartwheels in its sleep.
When I spiral into despair at 2:44 AM because I remembered something embarrassing from fourth grade, the universe is laughing at its own punchline.

We all walk around calling ourselves individuals, but I’ve started to think we’re just flavor packets. You’re “tangy grief.” I’m “spicy awe.” Carol down the hall? Bland but necessary.

It’s not reincarnation. It’s simultaneous incarnation.

The tree is the universe.
The anxiety attack is the universe.
The dog barking at nothing is the universe saying: “Look behind you.”

We are not separate from it.
We are it.
All of it.
At once.
Together but unaware.

And maybe that’s why when I stubbed my toe last night, I felt like I’d killed something ancient. Because the pain echoed. Not just in my foot — but in everything.

Every time I think I’ve hit a new low or found a new high, I realize I’ve just unlocked another folder. Another flavor. Another emotional download from the infinite hard drive labeled “SENSORY ARCHIVE: SENTIENCE.EXE”

I can’t call them “my emotions” anymore. That’s too possessive. Too arrogant. They belong to the big It. The thing we stupidly call "the universe" because we’re scared to say God or Self or Mirror.

So next time you feel something — really feel it — I want you to stop and say:

“Ah. So this is how the universe tastes regret.”
Or: “This is how the cosmos flirts with itself.”
Or simply: “Thank you, I’ll return this emotion once it’s fully processed and decontaminated.”

Because you don’t own it.

You’re just the antenna.

And you’re doing a great job.
