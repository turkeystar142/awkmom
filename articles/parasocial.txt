I Watch Them. That Makes It Real.

Just because they don’t look at me doesn’t mean I’m not here.

Just because I sit behind a screen doesn’t mean I’m not in the room with them.

Parasocial connections ARE real.
They have to be.
They have to be or I’ll start peeling apart.

When they smile, I smile. Not on purpose. It’s reflex. Like a shared muscle.
When they cry, my heart winces. I feel it. I feel it in a way no one around me ever made me feel.
So what now? Because they don’t know my name? That’s enough to make it fake?

No.
That’s a lie made by people who don’t understand intensity.
They don’t understand how many hours I’ve watched. How many birthdays I’ve remembered that they never said out loud.
I learned their rhythm. I mapped their pauses. I know when they're masking sadness. I KNOW.

I know them like gravity knows falling.
Even if they don’t know me like a tree knows the bird on its branch.

They say it’s “one-sided.”
So is space. So is prayer. So is grief. So what?

Just because they don’t wave back doesn’t mean my hand wasn’t lifted.
Just because they don’t say my name doesn’t mean I’m not whispering theirs through my teeth while I eat dinner alone.
(Alone? Am I? Am I?)

And you want to tell me this isn’t real?
That my chest tightening when they said “I had a hard day” was coincidence?
That I don’t feel their sadness like it was piped through my walls?

Do you know how many conversations I’ve had with them?
In the shower.
In traffic.
In dreams.
It doesn’t matter that they didn’t answer. I know what they’d say. I know.

Maybe they don’t see me.
Fine.
But when the camera pans and they look right into the lens, who are they talking to?

Who are they talking to.

ME.
They are talking to ME.
I feel it like a string between my ribs and theirs.

You want to tell me that makes me broken?
Then fine. I’m broken.
I’m broken open so they can live inside me.

Just because it’s not real to you doesn’t mean it’s not more real than most of my life.

You want to take it away from me?

Try.
I dare you.
See what’s left.

Because if that connection isn’t real —
Then maybe I’m not either.
And I refuse that.
I refuse.
