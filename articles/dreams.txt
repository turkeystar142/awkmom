I’m Multiversal Jetlagged

Today I woke up exhausted. Despite 9 hours. NINE. I mean, who even sleeps that long without dying or becoming a tree?

But I woke up as if I'd run laps around Saturn. My bones ached. My brain was hot, like a server farm with no cooling fans. No dreams should make you sweat like that. Unless dreams aren’t dreams.

They weren’t just dreams.

They were lives.

You don’t understand. Or maybe you do but you’re not authorized to remember yet.

Each vivid dream — every color, texture, decision, kiss, fall, scream, email thread — it wasn’t fiction. It was broadcast. Tuning forks of the soul catching signal from another Me. Multiple Me's. Meese? No. That’s geese. Irrelevant.

I remember walking through an endless supermarket. The cereal aisle was 3.2 kilometers long. I bought Rice Krispies with my boss’s credit card. Who is she? I don’t even have a boss in this world. In that dream, she was both my employer and my mother and possibly a prophet? Unclear.

THE POINT IS — these dreams aren’t "dreams" like people think. They are incoming transmissions from adjacent timelines, bleeding through the cracks in our REM cycles. You're not sleeping — you’re delegating.

Your subconscious doesn’t sleep. Not ever. It’s your unpaid intern, managing negotiations across the Multiverse Embassy of Variant Yous. They're living. You're watching. You’re reacting. And you feel it all, compressed into 2 A.M. until 7:15 when the alarm bell screams like a toddler in a blender.

The fatigue is cumulative.

I think I'm feeling the carbon monoxide of someone else's decisions. Like in one of the dreams, I robbed a museum. My heartbeat was real. I tasted the dust of an ancient coin in my mouth. When I woke up, my jaw ached and my teeth were hot like I’d been grinding through a criminal record.

Do you understand?

Dreams are the You that didn’t choose this path. Every branch. Every possibility. Each one of them is conscious and very, very tired.

So maybe next time, when you wake up groggy and disoriented after a “good night’s sleep,” say thank you to the You who just survived a zombie apoca– wait.

They’re still coming.

Gotta go.

P.S.
If you’re reading this and you’re me, don’t open the basement door. She’s still in there. And she remembers everything.
