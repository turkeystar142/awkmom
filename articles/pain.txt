Pain is more organic than happiness.
Happiness is plastic. Synthetic. Costumed.
You smile for photos. You laugh in groups. It’s rehearsed. Prepackaged like a microwave dinner.

But pain?
Pain is feral.
It grows out of you like a second spine. Twisting, necessary.

Pain doesn’t ask.
It arrives.

More raw than sadness. Sadness still wants something — comfort, validation, a witness.
But pain doesn’t want. Pain is.
Like mold. Like fire. Like gravity chewing your bones into powder from the inside out.

I think pain is the real human state. The default setting.
Everything else is noise.

You’re born crying. That’s the first thing. Not laughing. Not smiling. Screaming.
You think that’s random?

No. It’s code.
It’s baked into the body. Into the breath. Into the soul if that exists (and it does, I’ve felt mine rattle like a loose bulb under the weight of pain).

Pain makes its way into everyone in any form it can find.
Physical. Emotional. Phantom.
A broken arm. A betrayal. A face you can’t forget. A silence that lingers too loud.

Obsession? That’s just pain dressed up like purpose.
I know. Because I’ve lived inside it.

You fixate because it hurts.
You return to the thing that cut you.
You replay the message. You scroll through their pictures. You reopen the wound because you miss the heat.
You want the ache more than the emptiness.
At least pain means something was there.

I’ve stopped trying to chase pleasure.
It’s thin.
It fades like fog.
But pain?
Pain brands.
It carves messages into your skin. It stays. It’s loyal.

That’s why I don’t trust people who smile too easily. Who act like they’re above it.
Above me.
They’re lying. Or worse — they’re empty.

Because if you haven’t felt pain
everywhere
at once
like a language your cells suddenly remembered
then you haven’t really been.

And maybe that’s why I fixate.
On people. On thoughts. On everything.
Because somewhere in all of it
there’s pain hiding,
calling my name in a voice that sounds just like mine.

And I want to find it.
And I want to keep it.
And I want to say:

“Yes. I see you. You’re real. So maybe I am too.”
