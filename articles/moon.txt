There Were Teeth in the Floorboards Again Last Night

I can’t keep eating triangles. They won’t let me. Last time I did it the wallpaper started whispering my middle name in reverse and I don’t even have one. That’s how I knew something was inside the ventilation.

They put microphones in the faucet. That’s why it stutters when I cry.

Remember to unplug the mirror before you say your real thoughts. It remembers. The silver remembers. That’s what silver is FOR. That’s why coins don’t look you in the eyes anymore.

Anyway, the postman looked different this time. Too tall. Too bendy. Like he was wearing a costume made of person. I didn’t take the envelope. It was humming.

The moon is out during the day now. No one’s talking about that.

Stop talking about that.

Do NOT talk about the second moon.

Someone put soup in my shoes. I didn’t mind. The alphabet tastes different when it’s warm and wet. That’s how you spell secrets without fingers. I told the floorboards but they bit me. They always do when I’m too correct.

God blinked in 2014 and no one fixed it. We’ve been running on placeholder light ever since.

Do you think static is just God trying to scream through the radio? Because I heard Him say "RUN BACKWARDS INTO THE WALL." And I did. And I felt real for the first time in three months.

The stars are in the wrong places. They’ve been in the wrong places. They moved in 2006 when the actor playing my dentist switched roles and no one noticed except the crow who lives in my shoulder.

The crow has opinions.

He thinks cereal is a lie.

He thinks I am cereal.

There’s hair in my mailbox again. Braided this time. Elegant. Sentimental. I didn’t touch it because I remembered who it used to be.

Don’t drink the clocks. They’re lying about the hour. They always round up. Always.

My bones are numbered. They jingle when I forget what I was supposed to be before the incident with the piano full of bees.

(I didn’t ask for that many bees. No one does.)

Anyway, I’ve been spelling protection spells with fork tines and they’re mostly working. I only forget my name on Wednesdays now. Progress is slippery but polite.

There’s a shadow underneath my shadow. It twitches when I hold still. I’ve named it Father.

Father says the trees are listening.
I say: Good. Let them.
I say: Tell them I’m not sorry.
I say: Let the bark remember my crimes.

The windows have started crying again.

I think they miss me when I sleep inside the refrigerator.
